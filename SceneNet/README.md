Introduced by Handa et al. in SceneNet: Understanding Real World Indoor Scenes With Synthetic Data

SceneNet is a dataset of labelled synthetic indoor scenes. There are several labeled indoor scenes, including:

11 Bedroom scenes with 428 objects
15 Office scenes with 1,203 objects
11 Kitchen scenes with 797 objects
10 Living Room scenes with 715 objects
10 Bathrooms with 556 objects

Repository of Labelled Synthetic Indoor Scenes. This dataset is increasingly being used beyond standard computer vision problems e.g. semantic segmentation, optic flow, 3D scene reconstruction etc. to now physical scene understanding and Deep Reinforcement Learning with agents interacting with their 3D environments.
